  <Description xml:space="preserve">A disconnect component deletes the association between two sets of class
instances in a given association role. 
The instances to disconnect are identified using two conditional expressions, 
one for each of the class that participates to the association role.
A disconnect component specification consists of two parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The specification of the association role to which the operation refers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One conditional expression for each of the two classes participating to 
the association role (called &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; entity). 
The conditional expression identifies the set of class instances to be disconnected. 
If both conditional expressions retrieve a set of objects, all the possible objects pair 
for which a connection exists are disconnected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Description>
  <InputDescription xml:space="preserve" name="Condition-Name">The parameter associated to one of the Conditional Expressions
defined on the source or target class of the operation.</InputDescription>  
  <OutputDescription xml:space="preserve" name="Source (set of) Class-Name">The key attributes values of the object(s) of the source class of the association
role that have been disconnected; this can be a
subset of the input objects of the operation, in case of partial
or total failure.</OutputDescription>  
  <OutputDescription xml:space="preserve" name="Target (set of) Class-Name">The key attributes values of the object(s) of the target class of the association
role that have been disconnected; this can be a subset
of the input objects of the operation, in case of partial or
