  <Description xml:space="preserve">A reconnect component deletes the association between two sets of class instances 
in a given association role and subsequently creates a new one with usually 
different class instances. The source instances from which to disconnect and
connect and the target instances are identified through the Source conditional expression
and the Target conditional expression. Optionally, a Disconnect Target conditional expression
can be specified in order to disconnect only some instances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The component will first disconnect all Disconnect Target instances from the Source classes;
if no Disconnect Target conditional expression is specified, all instances connected to the source ones
will be disconnected. Next, the component connects all Target instances to the same Source instances.</Description>
