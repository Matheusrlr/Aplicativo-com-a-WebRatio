  <Description xml:space="preserve">A login operation verifies the user's credentials (username and password)
to grant access to non public site views.
The login operation takes in input a username and a password; 
if verification succeeds, the login operation redirects the user to the home page or operation
of the site view of the default group of the user.
If authentication succeeds but the group has no default site view, or no default group is associated with
the user, the operation follows its outgoing Succes flow. Otherwise, the Error flow of the login operation is followed.
The predefined Error flow code 'Internal Error' permits to distinguish between authentication failure (e.g. wrong credentials) 
and internal error (e.g. database error). 
A login operation is typically preceded by an form, which permits the user to input his credentials.
